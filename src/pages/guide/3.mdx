Here's the deal - if you want to replace the content you get from social media with other things, there's a few important legacy technologies it's in your interest to get to grips with.

## >: RSS

[RSS, or Really Simple Syndication](https://rss.com/blog/how-do-rss-feeds-work/#:~:text=RSS%20stands%20for%20Really%20Simple,an%20easy%20to%20read%20format.), is a very old and very reliable web standard for distributing content on the internet. The way it works is, as the name suggests, really simple:

- A website distributes a feed (usually at a link like `https://website.com/rss.xml`) that contains the content of their "RSS feed" - essentially just a chronological list of posts on the site.
- You, the consumer, using an <Buzzword definition="An app that lets you collect, organize, and read the content on RSS feeds.">RSS reader</Buzzword> (more on that in a little), automatically retrieve the content of the site's RSS feed every time it updates - and then you can automatically stay up to date with new site updates, blog posts, articles, or podcasts posted by the site.

That's it. Using your RSS reader, you can collect feeds from your favorite blogs, newspapers, magazines, or podcasts in one place, and have that collection automatically update itself every time you open your RSS reader. Many RSS readers exist for a wide variety of platforms, but I've listed some of the most well-regarded ones below.

> <Icon name="feather:edit" class={"inline"} size={16}/> To start, I highly recommend selecting a reader that isn't web-based. As always, you should be trying to keep as much of your data on your machine as possible - and web-based options are much more likely to come with feed limits. 

<DatabaseView title={"RSS Readers"} className="mb-4" hideOptions={{city: true, category: true, requireRSS: true, requireNewsletter: true}} defaultOptions={{category: "reader"}}/>

As we go further into the guide, I'm going to specifically note websites that have active and up-to-date RSS feeds so that you can subscribe to them. In most RSS readers, the process is as simple as clicking "New Feed," and then copy-and-pasting the feed URL. Sometimes it's even easier than that - a lot of readers have the capability to auto-detect a website's RSS feed even if you can't find it manually, so a lot of the time pasting the site's homepage URL will be enough.

It's also important to note that some existing platforms have RSS feeds built in. In particular, [Substack](https://substack.com/), [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/), [SpaceHey](https://spacehey.com/), [Neocities](https://neocities.org/), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/), and [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) all have RSS functionality built-in, so if you currently follow any creators on those sites who you want to keep up with, you can just paste their URL into your RSS reader and you should be good to go.

With all that said, while RSS is still very widely used, support can still be spotty in certain corners of the web. Because of that, there's another tool we have to have at our disposal: email.

## >: Email and Newsletters
You might think you hate email. You don't. You hate spam, and you hate work. I also hate spam, and I also (mostly) hate work. These things are not a necessary part of email - and with just a few good choices, you can more-or-less abolish them entirely.

First off, if you're willing to make yet another online account, I would recommend that you create a new email address for non-professional communication. I did this when I joined the indie web in early 2024, and (1) it was nice to have a fresh start on the inbox and (2) it let me separate the fifty quintillion accounts and mailing lists I had attached to the One True Email Address I've had since middle school from the more intimate (and more important) personal communication I have with folks on the indie web. If there's an email in that inbox, 99% of the time it's because an actual human being wanted to talk to me about something. That's a lovely dynamic to have, and it's dramatically changed my relationship with email for the better - I guarantee it'll do the same for you.

But whether you make a new email account or not, you've got to get in the habit of staying on top of your email. If you've got 500+ unread in your personal inbox, don't even bother trying to tame it all - just declare [email bankruptcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_bankruptcy#:~:text=Email%20bankruptcy%20is%20deleting%20or,to%20Sherry%20Turkle%20in%202002.) and toss that shit into the garbage bin. After that, you can take several concrete steps to avoid getting into that situation in the future. Namely:

1. **Make sure to check your email on at least a weekly basis.** It simply does not get out of hand if you don't let it. Set a reminder on your phone, if that's what you need.
2. If something's not interesting to you, or if you're subscribed to a list you don't want to be, or if someone's contacting you who you don't want to be - **unsubscribe, block, and report spam.** If you're relentless in your pursuit of an inbox that's exclusively full of emails that you actually want to read, you'll have an inbox that's exclusively full of emails you want to read.

As to what you should fill your newly clean inbox with (aside from personal communication with other folks on the indie web), the answer is simple: newsletters.

Though they've become less common, many organizations, businesses, and people still have active newsletters, and places like [Substack](https://substack.com) have them built-in to every blog they host. Newsletters - when available - are so much better than following things on social media because of how direct, modular, and easily organizable they are. Your email inbox is chronological by default, and it comes with built-in support for tagging, filters, search, and other methods of categorization. 

> <Icon name="feather:edit" class={"inline"} size={16}/> It's also worth noting that there's an open-source tool called [Kill The Newsletter](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/), which allows you to turn most email newsletters into RSS feeds. It might not work for your use case, but it's worth a try if you prefer RSS to email as a content feed.

## >: Bookmarks

Since leaving social media, one of the most powerful tools in my digital toolbox has been browser bookmarks. For all intents and purposes, it's totally replaced the "following" feeds across my old social media accounts. With categorized bookmarks, it's easy to keep track of every community, artist, and project I want to keep up with - even if they don't have RSS feeds or newsletters.

I've linked guides for managing your bookmarks on every popular browser below:
- [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/188842?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android)
- [Firefox (Desktop)](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/bookmarks-firefox), [Firefox (Android)](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-delete-and-view-bookmarked-webpages-firefox-android), [Firefox (iOS)](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-add-remove-edit-and-move-bookmarks-firefox-ios)
- [Safari (Mac)](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/bookmark-webpages-to-revisit-ibrw1039/mac), and [Safari (iOS)](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/bookmark-a-website-iph42ab2f3a7/ios)
- [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/add-a-site-to-my-favorites-in-microsoft-edge-eb40d818-fd1f-cb19-d943-6fcfd1d9a935)

After all of that, we we should finally be ready to get into the meat and potatoes of the process: replacing your content.
