If you want to replace the content you get from social media with other things, there's a few important legacy technologies that will make things a lot easier.

## >: RSS

[RSS, or Really Simple Syndication](https://rss.com/blog/how-do-rss-feeds-work/#:~:text=RSS%20stands%20for%20Really%20Simple,an%20easy%20to%20read%20format.), is a very old and very reliable web standard for distributing content on the internet. It is, as the name suggests, really simple:

- A website makes distributes a chronological list of posts on their site called an "RSS Feed."
- You, the consumer, using an <Buzzword definition="An app that lets you collect, organize, and read the content on RSS feeds.">RSS reader</Buzzword> (more on that in a little), automatically retrieve the content of the site's RSS feed every time it updates - and then you can automatically stay up to date with new site updates, blog posts, articles, or podcasts posted by the site.

That's it. Using your RSS reader, you can collect feeds from your favorite blogs, newspapers, magazines, or podcasts in one place, and have that collection automatically update itself every time you open your RSS reader. Many RSS readers exist for a wide variety of platforms, but I've listed some of the most well-regarded ones below.

<DatabaseView title={"RSS Readers"} className="mb-4" hideOptions={{city: true, category: true, requireRSS: true, requireNewsletter: true}} defaultOptions={{category: "reader"}}/>

As we go further into the guide, I'm going to specifically note websites that have active and up-to-date RSS feeds so that you can subscribe to them. In most RSS readers, the process is as simple as clicking "New Feed," and then copy-and-pasting the feed's <Buzzword definition="The address of a web page. It's the thing you put into your web browser to go to an new website (e.g. https://unplatform.fromthesuperhighway.com)">URL</Buzzword> into your reader. Sometimes it's even easier than that - a lot of readers have the capability to auto-detect a website's RSS feed even if you can't find it manually, so a lot of the time pasting the site's homepage URL will be enough.

<blockquote>
<p>💡 Note: You can practice adding an RSS feed to your reader right now! You can find the Unplatform RSS feed by <span class="md:hidden">pulling up the hamburger menu in the top right corner and clicking on this icon: <Icon class={"inline mb-[0.1rem]"} name={"feather:rss"}/></span><span className="hidden md:inline">clicking on the RSS icon (<Icon class={"inline mb-[0.1rem]"} name={"feather:rss"}/>) in the navbar.</span></p><br/>

<p>Once you've pulled it up, copy the URL and add it to your RSS reader. After that, you'll get automatic updates every time there's a new thing added to the Unplatform database!</p>
</blockquote>

It's also important to note that some existing platforms have RSS feeds built-in. In particular, [Substack](https://substack.com/), [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/), [SpaceHey](https://spacehey.com/), [Neocities](https://neocities.org/), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/), [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), and even [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) all have RSS functionality built-in, so if you currently follow any creators on those sites who you want to keep up with, you can add their URL into your RSS reader and you should be good to go.

With all that said, while RSS is still very widely used, support can still be spotty in certain corners of the web. Because of that, there's another tool we have to have at our disposal: email.

## >: Email and Newsletters
If checking your email inbox fills you with dread - worry not. With just a few good choices, you can make it fill you with joy instead.

First off, if you're willing to make yet another online account, I would recommend that you create a new email address for non-professional communication. I did this when in early 2024, and (1) it was nice to have a fresh start on the inbox and (2) it let me separate the fifty quintillion accounts and mailing lists I had attached to the One True Email Address I've had since middle school from the more intimate (and more important) communication I have with folks on the indie web. If there's an email in that inbox, 99.9% of the time it's because an actual human being wanted to talk to me about something. That's a lovely dynamic to have, and it's dramatically changed my relationship with email for the better - I guarantee it'll do the same for you.

With that said, regardless of whether you make a new email account or not, you've got to get in the habit of staying on top of your email. If you've got 500+ unread in your personal inbox, don't even bother trying to tame it all - just declare [email bankruptcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_bankruptcy#:~:text=Email%20bankruptcy%20is%20deleting%20or,to%20Sherry%20Turkle%20in%202002.) and toss that shit into the garbage bin. After that, you can take several concrete steps to avoid getting into that situation in the future. Namely:

1. **Make sure to check your email on at least a weekly basis.** It simply does not get out of hand if you don't let it. Set a reminder on your phone, if that's what you need.
2. If something's not interesting to you, or if you're subscribed to a list you don't want to be, or if someone's contacting you who you don't want to be - **unsubscribe, block, and report spam.** If you're relentless in your pursuit of an inbox that's exclusively full of emails that you actually want to read, you'll have an inbox that's exclusively full of emails you want to read.

As to what you should fill your newly clean inbox with (aside from personal communication with other folks on the indie web), the answer is simple: newsletters.

Though they've become less common, many organizations, businesses, and people still have active newsletters, and places like [Substack](https://substack.com) have them built-in to every blog they host. Newsletters - when available - are so much better than following things on social media because of how direct, modular, and easily organizable they are. Your email inbox is chronological by default, and it comes with built-in support for tagging, filters, search, and other methods of categorization.

It might not work for your use case, but it's worth a try if you prefer RSS to email as a content feed.

## >: Bookmarks

Since leaving social media, one of the most powerful tools in my digital toolbox has been browser bookmarks. For all intents and purposes, it's totally replaced the "following" feeds across my old social media accounts. With categorized bookmarks, it's easy to keep track of every community, artist, and project I want to keep up with - even if they don't have RSS feeds or newsletters.

I've linked guides for managing your bookmarks on every popular browser below:
- [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/188842?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android)
- [Firefox (Desktop)](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/bookmarks-firefox), [Firefox (Android)](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-delete-and-view-bookmarked-webpages-firefox-android), [Firefox (iOS)](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-add-remove-edit-and-move-bookmarks-firefox-ios)
- [Safari (Mac)](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/bookmark-webpages-to-revisit-ibrw1039/mac), and [Safari (iOS)](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/bookmark-a-website-iph42ab2f3a7/ios)

After all of that, we we should finally be ready to get into the meat and potatoes of the process: replacing your content.
