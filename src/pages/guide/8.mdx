If you've gotten to the end of this process, I am immensely proud of you. Taking back control of your digital life from Silicon Valley is no small feat.

Maybe you're wondering about where to go next - worry not, I have recommendations for that too:

- Take a look at the full [Unplatform database](/database) - it's got the full list of every recommendation we have, and it's an amazing starting point for your web-surfing journey! There's over <TotalEntries/> links in it for you to explore - and in almost all cases, the sites we link to have recommendations of their own. The real Internet is out there, and it's waiting for you to come and join it.
- Check out the [Unplatform library](/library). It has a list of links to articles, books, and other material about the history of Silicon Valley's conquest of the Internet - and how people are starting to resist it. This guide would not have been possible without the decades of research and theory-crafting done by immensely talented and heroic people before me.
- Contribute to the Unplatform project. I'm always looking for feedback, nominations for new websites, publications, and organizations to add to our database of recommendations. Each addition makes the guide more useful for future users - which in turn makes it easier for folks to escape social media. You can contribute on <a href="https://github.com/alligatorjazz/unplatform">Github</a> or by [emailing me](mailto:unplatform@fromthesuperhighway.com).
- I'm also looking for people interested in being part of the eventual Unplatform editorial board. If you are (or know) someone who has a vested interest in the indie web and the work and / or credentials to back it up, [send them my way](mailto:unplatform@fromthesuperhighway.com) - I'd like to talk.

Maybe this guide wasn't enough for you to press "delete account," and that's totally fine. If it wasn't, I'd love to talk more with you directly about what your needs are and how Unplatform could meet them. *Please* don't be afraid to [reach out to me](mailto:unplatform@fromthesuperhighway.com) and tell me a little bit about your situation.

Looking forward to seeing you on the indie web,

\- ajazz
