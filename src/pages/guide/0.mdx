Hey! I'm [ajazz](https://ajazz.neocities.org) - glad to have you here. If you've already clicked on this link, I'm going to assume you don't need any convincing as to *why* you should leave conventional social media platforms. (If you do, try giving [CJ The X's Web 1.5 Manifesto](https://www.cjthex.com/what-is-to-be-done/) a read, and then come back.) This guide is intended for the "hostages" - those who *want* to leave <Buzzword definition="The era of the web dominated by ad-supported platforms that host user-generated content (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter).">Web 2.0</Buzzword> social media platforms, but for whatever reason feel trapped or obligated to stay.

This guide is going to have several parts. First, I'm going to set some expectations about what you can hope to get out of this process. Second, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your level of technical expertise. Then, I'm going to walk you through the core technologies that we're going to use throughout the rest of the guide.

After that, we'll be off to the races - we'll go through all the potential use cases you might have for social media, and I'll give you specific alternative recommendations for replacing each one. Finally, we'll debrief a little bit, and I'll give you some advice for how to go past leaving social media and start *joining* the indie web - and bring your friends along as well.

One final note: **this guide has to use a few necessary cookies to record your responses to the form questions in order to tailor the guide to your needs. This data isn't stored on our servers, and never leaves your computer - it's purely for your benefit.**

Does that sound good to you?
