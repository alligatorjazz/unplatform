			</h2>
			<p>
				<Prompt />I mean ad-supported, data harvesting social platforms
				platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and X, just to name a few.
				In general, I am trying to help you leave sites that:
			</p>
			<ul class="flex flex-col list-disc ml-8 py-4">
				<li>
					rely on the sale of ads and / or user data to generate
					revenue;
				</li>
				<li>
					deliver content to their users exclusively or primarily
					through algorithmic feeds;
				</li>
				<li>
					cannot sustain themselves with their own revenue (and as a
					result rely on speculative investment to survive);
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Almost all the dysfunction of the modern internet can be traced
				back to one of the above dynamics - and it's those dynamics that
				Unplatform seeks to help you escape.

				<Prompt prompt="?" />{"What's the indie web?"}
			</h2>
			<p>
				<Prompt />The indie web (or alt web, or <a
					href="https://www.cjthex.com/what-is-to-be-done/"
					target="_blank">Web 1.5</a
				>, or whatever you want to call it) is composed of the vast
				network of websites, organizations, and software projects on the
				internet run by people outside the orbit of Web 2.0 and Silicon
				Valley.
			</p>

			<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold">
				<Prompt prompt="?" />{"Why would I want to join the indie web?"}
			</h2>
			<p>
				<Prompt />While "log off" and "touch grass" are perfectly
				acceptable reactions to the current digital landscape, the fact
				remains that there's presumably some reason you were using
				social media in the first place. Maybe it was for sharing art,
				or reading news, or getting notified about events - in any case,
				if you still want to do those things without engaging with the
				Web 2.0 hellscape, the indie web is the way to do it.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Over the last few years, you've probably heard defeatist truisms
				thrown around like "there's only five websites now" or "the
				internet is dead." I'm here to tell you that those "truisms" are
				false, and the proof of their falseness lies in the indie web.
				On my newsletter, <a
					class="no-underline uppercase text-[#f1b5ea] font-bold"
					href="https://fromthesuperhighway.com"
					target="_blank">{">: From The Superhighway"}</a
				>, I've been covering a ton of vibrant art projects, online
				communities, and public utilities outside traditional social
				media platforms since September 2024 - and there's always far
				too many exciting things happening at any one time to fit them
				all in any one issue.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				You probably haven't heard of most of those exciting things, and
				that's not your fault. Web 2.0 - and the platforms that dominate
				it - have kept them from you.<a
					target="_blank"
					href="https://www.404media.co/meta-is-blocking-links-to-decentralized-instagram-competitor-pixelfed/"
				>
					Recently they've started doing it on purpose</a
				>, but they've <i>always</i> done it by design. Unplatform is here
				to rectify that.

				<Prompt prompt="?" />{`Who are you?`}
			</h2>
			<p>
				<Prompt />I'm <a
					href="https://ajazz.neocities.org"
					target="_blank">ajazz</a
				>. I'm a writer and web developer who's been publishing work
				online since 2017, and I've been involved in the indie web in
				some capacity since early 2024.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				My motivation for creating Unplatform is simple. Once upon a
				time, I, too, was a digital defeatist that believed that the
				internet was beyond saving, and that Silicon Valley had achieved
				total control over the digital world. It's been a deeply
				humbling and extremely inspiring experience to be proven wrong -
				and not only do I no longer believe that the internet is a lost
				cause, I believe there's never been a better time to take it
				back.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				But it won't be easy. Silicon Valley is holding our communities,
				careers, and conciousnesses hostage. They lured us onto their
				platforms over the course of 20 years with the promise of access
				and convenience, and now that they've gone completely <a
					href="https://www.404media.co/decentralized-social-media-is-the-only-alternative-to-the-tech-oligarchy/"
					>mask off</a
				>, they're betting on the idea that we've got too much invested
				in them to walk away. Unplatform is here to help you prove them
				wrong.

				<h3 class="text-lg italic">Recommendations</h3>
				<p>
					Our <a href="/database">database</a> is in constant need of recommendations
					for new software, services, and sites. We're currently looking
					for recommendations for the following:
				</p>
				<br />
				<ul class="list-disc ml-8">
					<li>
						Event venues, magazines, newspapers, or other websites
						with <b>active</b> RSS feeds or newsletters;
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Newbie-friendly</b> website builders and blogging / microblogging
						platforms to help indie web newcomers get up and running
						fast;
					</li>
					<li>
						Alternative social platforms that promote human
						curation, creation, and connection, <b>without</b> selling
						user data for profit, forcing the use of algorithmic feeds,
						or using user content as AI training data.
					</li>
					<li>
						Important or foundational articles about the past and
						present of social media, the Web, and internet for the
						Unplatform <a href="/library">library</a>.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<p>
					If you're interested in contributing a recommendation to
					Unplatform, you can do it through <a
						href="https://github.com/alligatorjazz/unplatform"
						>Github</a
					>, or you can shoot an email to <a
						href="mailto:unplatform@fromthesuperhighway.com"
						>unplatform@fromthesuperhighway.com</a
					>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mb-4">
				<h3 class="text-lg italic">Teammates</h3>
				<p>
					While Unplatform is currently a one-man show, I don't want
					it to stay that way forever. My ambition is to have
					Unplatform be managed by an editorial committee staffed by
					committed partisans of the indie web. <br />
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					If you are (or know someone) who has a strong interest in
					the indie web and the work history, projects, or credentials
					to back it up, <a
						href="mailto:unplatform@fromthesuperhighway.com"
					>
						shoot me an email</a
					> - I'd like to talk.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mb-4">
				<h3 class="text-lg italic">Feedback</h3>
				<p>
					Unplatform is only worthwhile if people are getting real
					utility from it. I'm always looking for feedback on every
					aspect of the project, whether it be related to the
					interactive guide, our database, our library, or our design.
					If you have any general feedback about the project, please
					send it to <a
						href="mailto:unplatform@fromthesuperhighway.com"
						>unplatform@fromthesuperhighway.com</a
					>. I'll try my best to get back to you.
