At times like these one has to envy the theorists of old whose worked followed the now-unimaginably indulgent timelines of the railroad, printing press, and letters carried on ships traveling the sea. Trying to pin down a contemporary social, political, or cultural phenomenon long enough to analyze it is already a Heruclean enough task on its own. Trying to make sure said analysis stands the test of time - or even just the test of the next few weeks - is even harder. Nowhere is this dynamic more true than in the field of digital technology.

I say all of this not (just) to complain about the 21st century's overwhelming pace, but to emphasize that the few thousand words that follow here are not to be understood as scripture. You may read this document a week from now, or a month from now, or a year from now, or even a decade from now - and it is possible in all of those scenarios that the battleground you are fighting within is essentially unrecognizable from the one t

<!-- idk if i should emphasize this. i'm gonna cite things from, like, 2007. sometimes things stay relevant -->

There are only five websites on the internet: Google, ChatGPT, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. This is a statement that is at is simultaneously wildly wrong and also a fundamentally accurate depiction of how a tremendous number of people in the anglosphere interface with the modern Web. Some readers may say that I've left out some key websites - like TikTok, YouTube, or Pinterest, for example - but I would challenge those readers to consider how many of the users of those websites are accessing their services by putting a URL into an address bar instead of downloading a mobile application from their walled garden of choice. The statistics seem to suggest that users lean towards the latter. #src

This state of affairs could not be further from the Web that I encountered when I first came online. At the time, in the mid-to-late 2000s, it was very rare that I ended a session of "computer time" *without* stumbling upon some new forum, arcade, fan wiki, or personal website. It was a world that was positively drowning in hyperlinks. Google was very much around, and it was much more genuinely useful then than it is now, but it was just one method among others. The "links" section of even the most barebones websites often blew Google out of the water when it came to finding what you were looking for - especially if what you were looking for wasn't mainstream.

There are names for the epochs I am discussing here. The age of the Geocity, webring, and internet forum is known as Web 1.0. Our age - or, to put it more accurately, the age that is currently ending - is known as Web 2.0. We currently stand at the precipice of the next age of the Web, and the fight to define what that age will be has already begun. 

This document is an argument for one particular vision for that new age and a battle plan for achieving it. It is not an argument against digital technology in and of itself, nor is it an argument that indulges in uncritical nostalgia for the "old Web." Web 1.0 was not a utopia, and as we'll discuss, much of Sillicon Valley's greatest contemporary excesses are a feature, rather than a bug, of the fundemental realities of digital infrastructure. It is an argument that is against platforms and for institutions, it is an argument against the control that Silicon Valley wields over global society, and it is an argument that acknowledges that this fight is just one of many in the larger conflict against neoliberal capitalism - and, perhaps more importantly, the conflict *over* what will replace it.
